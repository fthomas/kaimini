Kaimini
=======

Introduction:

Documentation:
  The API documentation can be found here:
    http://www.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/~fthomas/kaimini/doc/

Dependencies:
  Kaimini is written in C++. To build it, the C++ Standard Library, some
  parts of the Boost C++ Libraries[1], Minuit2[2] and the GNU Scientific
  Library (GSL)[3] are required. To actually use Kaimini, a spectrum
  calculator like SPheno[4] or SOFTSUSY[5] is needed.

  [3] http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
  [4] http://www.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/~porod/SPheno.html
  [5] http://projects.hepforge.org/softsusy/

  For development of Kaimini additional software is required. Doxygen[6]
  is used for building the API documentation, CppUnit[7] is required to
  compile the unit tests, and CMake[8] is used to build them.
