Drivers:
 - add a GSL driver
 - add an R driver
Output:
 - KaiminiInfo:
   - add number of function calls
   - add information about which driver was used
 - add an additional block for the covariance matrix
 - investigate what else FunctionMinimum contains that is interesting
   for us
 - make output of parameter values (while minimization) configurable in
   the SLHA
Kaimini:
 - add command-line options to select Driver and Fit and/or add
   entries to the SLHA to select Driver and Fit (calculator)
