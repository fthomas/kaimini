GSLDriver:
 - runSimplex:
   - determine the parameter errors
 - runSimulatedAnnealing:
   - make it work!

SimpleSLHAFit:
 - selectCalculator:
   - sanitize user input (http://xkcd.com/327/)

general:
 - the SLHAWorker hierarchy feels very stateful; can this be improved?
 - keep the test suite up-to-date
 - handle stalled calculators gracefully
 - use a special signal to interrupt the driver and to shutdown SLHAWorker
