GSLDriver:
 - runSimplex:
   - determine the parameter errors
 - runSimulatedAnnealing:
   - make it work!

SLHAWorker:
 - selectCalculator:
   - sanitize user input (http://xkcd.com/327/)
 - make chiSq() thread-safe

general:
 - the SLHAWorker hierarchy feels very stateful; can this be improved?
 - keep the test suite up-to-date
 - handle stalled calculators gracefully
 - use a special signal to interrupt the driver and to shutdown SLHAWorker
 - write my own parameters class that handles change of basis and that has
   (a)symmetric errors
 - let the user choose between different test functions
 - unify the output to stdout and make it easier to parse
 - add mechanism to store the calculations for intermediate parameter points
