Fits:
 - initialize most SLHA blocks of mResult in SLHAFit
 - append random string to SimpleSLHAFit's mWorkingDir
Output:
 - KaiminiInfo:
   - add number of function calls
   - add information about which driver was used
 - investigate what else FunctionMinimum contains that is interesting
   for us
 - make output of parameter values (while minimization) configurable in
   the SLHA
Kaimini:
 - add command-line options to select Driver and Fit and/or add
   entries to the SLHA to select Driver and Fit (calculator)
 - catch the exceptions thrown by Boost's filesystem lib
 - use Boost's program_options instead of getopt.h
