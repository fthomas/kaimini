Fits:
 - initialize most SLHA blocks of mResult in SLHAFit
Output:
 - KaiminiInfo:
   - add number of function calls
   - add information about which driver was used
 - investigate what else FunctionMinimum contains that is interesting
   for us
 - make output of parameter values (while minimization) configurable in
   the SLHA
Kaimini:
 - add entries to the SLHA to select Driver

SimpleSLHAFit:
 - selectCalculator:
    - sanitize user input (http://xkcd.com/327/)
